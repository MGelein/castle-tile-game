# Castle Tile Game
The game that is famously named after a certain French Castle. I'm trying to make this as a personal challenge to make a proper multiplayer game, including all art and sound. Of course the rules are not of my invention.

## Tech Stack
The project runs vanilla JS, with the rendering done in P5.js. The 'backend' will be handled by Gun.js.
